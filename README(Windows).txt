I'm also trying to make this package avalible on Windows :)

## Setup

Run the "install" file:
- Change the directory to the main package file
- Type ```chmod +x windows_install.sh```
- Type ```dos2unix windows_install.sh```
- Type: ```./windows_install.sh```.
The package should then be set up for Windows.
